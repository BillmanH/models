## Topic Model Machine
Getting insights from topic models is tough. It's very iterative and requires a lot of manual tuning. My process here is my own recipe for getting the most value out of the LatentDirichletAllocation model in scikit learn. My goal is to create a sandardised set of deliverables that will enable a user to upload a datafile quickly, process and get an output file right away.
